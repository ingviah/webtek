        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
            As stated in P2 this project’s purpose was to unite fans and players while promoting Nonstop FK. This purpose has been fulfilled.
            The website contains all the informtation about the fotball team which was our goal. We have met the initial requirements and we have almost implemented 
            all the html, js and css as intend and stated in p2. There has been some minor structural changes we saw necessary when implementing the design, and one design changes to make the design more user-friendly. 
            The changes are described below.
        </p>

        <h3>Homepage.html</h3>
        <p>The table with the positions of the teams in the has been redesigned to make it more readable and nice to look at.</p>

        <h3>Changes to the file structure</h3>
        <p>newsarticle.js and newsmodal.js. Originally only planned on having one newsarticle.js file, but found it necessary to have both to support modularity. one for the large newsarticle popup, and one for the small newsarticle cards displayed at the homepage.</p>

        <h3>Minimum requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>OnClick.js</li>
            <p>Kasper fulfilled his JavaScript requirement with a user-defined function in OnClick.js which is used in the navbar and the homepage.</p>            
            <li>Hover.js</li>
            <p>The “Hover.js” function were fulfilled by Hedvig, and is used in the navbar.</p>            
            <li>Popup.js</li>
            <p>Thomas fulfilled the popup requirement which is used in the homepage, and Kasper validated it.</p>
            <li>NewsArticle.js and newsmodal.js</li>
            <p>Phillip defined the functions in newsArticle.js and newsmodal.js, which Thomas validated and used in homepage.html. </p>            
        </ul>

        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <img src="../img/work_inCharge.png" alt="work division">
        <p>we kept the original plan for the distribution of responsibility for files. But we did not implement team-info.js, instead we had newsarticle.js and newsmodal.js which Phillip were responsible for. And Thomas were in charge of popup. If one needed help, we collaborated to find a solution.</p>
        <h3>modularity</h3>
        <p>The modularity requirement was handled by everyone. We ensured modularity by creating javascript files for elements that were reused, like navbar, newsarticle and hover and onclik functions.  </p>
