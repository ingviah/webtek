            <li>Ease of navigation: testers found the website very easy to navigate, with essential features like the table 
                and latest articles being quickly identifiable and accessible.</li>
            <li>Clear and clean design: Many testers appreciated the clean, simple, and organized layout, which made the 
                site visually appealing and user-friendly.</li>
            <li>Relevant and comprehensive content: Testers noted that the website provided more detailed information 
                compared to other platforms like Instagram, with an appreciated overview of past matches and league standings.</li>
            <li>Intuitive user interface: Features like the news articles being pop-ups instead of redirecting to a new page, 
                and the ability to return to the homepage by clicking the logo, were well-received for enhancing user experience. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Summary negative feedback:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of clarity in section titles: Some testers found the naming of sections like "kampoppsett" confusing, suggesting
                more intuitive titles for better understanding.
            </li>
            <li>Feedback mechanism needs improvement: Testers suggested that the text in the feedback submission box should disappear 
                after submission to avoid confusion.</li>
            <li>Lack of differentiation in homepage elements: Testers observed that various elements on the homepage  seemed to blend
                together, recommending clearer separations or framing to distinguish between articles, tables, and upcoming matches. 
            </li>
            <li>Need for more detailed information: Suggestions included adding dates to news articles, clearer distinctions in 
                the league table standings, and providing more in-depth information about the players and revent matches. 
            </li>

        <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
        <p>
            We have very much liked the project work in this course. We have learned a lot about working together on a coding project, 
            and have been happy with work load within the group. This course will defenetly help with future coding projects.
